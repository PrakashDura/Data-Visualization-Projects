##Visualizing Relationships in Flower Dataset
Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the project Visualizing Relationships in Flower Dataset, which focuses on data visualization techniques. The project is divided into three main parts:

Part 1: Data and Initial Visualizations
In this section, the flower dataset is loaded, and initial visualizations are created to understand the data distribution and relationships between different features.

Part 2: Plotting Key Relationships and Distance Measurement
Two key figures are drawn to visualize specific feature relationships:

Petal Length vs. Petal Width
Petal Length vs. Sepal Width
Additionally, the Euclidean distance between the means of the selected features is calculated and presented.

Part 3: Exploring Feature Correlations
This part of the project investigates the correlation between different features in the dataset. A correlation matrix and visualizations are provided to better understand the relationships between features.

##Dependencies
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

##Acknowledgments
This project was completed as part of the coursework for Data Visualization at Tennessee State University. Special thanks to the instructors and peers for their support and guidance.
